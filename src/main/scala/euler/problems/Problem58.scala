  * Problem 58
  *
  * Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.
  *   (37)  36   35   34   33   32  (31)
  *    38  (17)  16   15   14  (13)  30
  *    39   18  ( 5)   4  ( 3)  12   29
  *    40   19    6    1    2   11   28
  *    41   20  ( 7)   8    9   10   27
  *    42   21   22   23   24   25   26
  *   (43)  44   45   46   47   48   49
  *
  * It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is
  * that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
  *
  * If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed.
  * If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both
  * diagonals first falls below 10%?
